Modular Linux PDA
-----------------

This project is a modular Linux PDA build based on RPi and SPI e-ink displays.
The plan is not to desing any particular enclosure, keyboard etc. but instead
provide bare minimum main board and software to allow anyone to build a
portable Linux machine with e-ink display. The software part that is e-ink
drivers as well as terminal and applications are implemented in
[gfxprim](https://github.com/gfxprim/).

> [!WARNING]
> This is not a completely finished project, putting it together requires
> electronics, soldering and software development skills.
